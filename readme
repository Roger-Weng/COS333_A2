Contributions:
We did mostly pair programming on the assignment. 

Here's the contributions from Yan (Roger) Weng: 
In reg.py, Roger wrote the function that calls database and prints output 
in the correct format to the terminal. In addition, Roger wrote the
function that deals with input strings that contain % or _ to 
make sure it's not interpreted as wildcards when feeding into sqlite. In
regdetails.py, Roger wrote the function that print info about
classes, department and professors. In db_connect.py, Roger 
wrote the function that search for specific classes given certain 
constraints(for reg.py). Roger also wrote get_class_table and get_course_info 
functions (for regdetails.py). 

Here's the contributions from Visva Ilava:




Help received: We received help from Professor Dondero on Ed. We asked about how the process of executing queries works.

Sources of information: Apart from questions we asked on Ed, we looked at lecture slides and handouts while doing the assignment.

Time spent on the assignment: 15 hours



Assessment of the assignment:
The assignment helped us to learn more about GUI programming and network
programming in Python. 



Specifically, the assignment helps us better understand sqlite and how to write prepared statements.
In addition, we also learned a lot about modularization and 
testing. One suggestion of improvement is that it might also be 
helpful for us to learn how to write/modify the database in the assignment.



All known bugs: No
