Contributions:
We did mostly pair programming on the assignment. 

Here's the contributions from Yan (Roger) Weng: 
In reg.py, Roger wrote the functions that create control frame, list frame,
central frame, window. In additon, Roger also wrote part of the functions 
that handle form sumbit and the main function.

In regserver.py, Roger mainly wrote the parts that handle get overviews and the main function.

dbconnect.py is very similar to what we used in assignment 1. Roger combined the functions in assignment 1
to 



Here's the contributions from Vishva Ilavelan:

In reg.py Vishva helped to write the event handling functions that display query data, as well as the logic behind the dialog
boxes. Furthermore, Vishva also worked on developing the nesting for the different frames in reg.py, as well as the client-side error
handling. In dbconnect.py, Vishva helped alter the functions so that the query data structures they returned adhered to the
communication protocol. In regserver.py, Vishva helped write the socket connection and connection request handling code. Lastly, 
Vishva helped




Help received: We received help from Professor Dondero on Ed. We asked about how the process of executing queries works.

Sources of information: Apart from questions we asked on Ed, we looked at lecture slides and handouts while doing the assignment.

Time spent on the assignment: 15 hours

Assessment of the assignment:
The assignment helped us to learn more about GUI programming and network
programming in Python. Specifically, the assignment helps us better understand how to compose a program with Python PyQt5 library. In addition, we also learned a lot about modularization and testing. One suggestion of improvement is that it might also be helpful for us to learn other GUI
builder tools.

All known bugs: No
